# Data Analytics Projects ðŸ“Š

This repository contains a collection of small data analytics projects I have completed using **Python**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, and publicly available datasets. Each project focuses on exploring real-world data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing insights, and deriving actionable conclusions.

The projects cover a variety of topics including career salaries, app store analytics, financial trends, LEGO products, and programming language popularity.
