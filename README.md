# Data Analytics Projects ðŸ“Š

This repository contains a collection of small data analytics projects I have completed using **Python**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, and publicly available datasets. Each project focuses on exploring real-world data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing insights, and deriving actionable conclusions.

The projects cover a variety of topics including career salaries, app store analytics, financial trends, LEGO products, and programming language popularity.

## Projects Overview

### Analyzing College Major Salaries
- Explore salary outcomes across college majors and analyze which fields lead to higher starting and mid-career earnings.

### Google Play Store Apps & Reviews Analysis
- Investigate trends in app categories, downloads, pricing strategies, and revenue potential in the Google Play Store.

### Google Trends and Real-World Data Analysis
- Analyze correlations between Google search trends and real-world financial/economic indicators like Tesla stock, Bitcoin, and U.S. unemployment rates.

### LEGO Dataset Analysis
- Examine LEGO set data to understand trends in set size, themes, historical growth, and complexity over time.

### Programming Language Trends
- Analyze Stack Exchange data to understand how programming language popularity has evolved over time.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Google Colab (for some projects)  
- CSV datasets from public sources
